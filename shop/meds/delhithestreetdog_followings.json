He was adopted out 3 years ago via our partner rescue @sunny_skys_animal_rescue. If you are interested in adopting Lemmy please contact Sunny Skies Animal Rescue.\n\nLemmy was adopted from our shelter a few years ago after his arrival from Delhi, India. It was clear from our initial reactions, Lemmy's life was far from kind, and he would need some help to ease his anxiety and fear. Through positive reinforcement training, Lemmy has come far and has become an amazing member of the family. Due to no fault of his own, Lemmy is seeking a new home now. Lemmy has a calm and gentle demeanor that quickly warms the hearts of those he meets. Whether people meet him quickly on a bus or at home, Lemmy finds himself quickly warming up to those around him. Initially Lemmy struggled with separation anxiety and fear-based reactivity to other dogs. He has improved over the years with the help of a trainer, and would benefit from continued positive reinforcement training. Lemmy's previous owner describes him as a low energy pup who enjoys going on casual walks. Lemmy knows many commands, and his previous owner has provided a detailed list of these commands along with a guide to help ease him into his new home. What makes Lemmy a harder dog to find a home for is that he does not get along well with other animals. His interaction while going on walks is overall positive and non-reactive unless other dogs get too close, in which case Lemmy becomes defensive. Lemmy's separation anxiety causes him to be very vocal when left alone, so a condo or apartment would not be an ideal situation for him. Lemmy has been known to do well with children, although due to some of his behavior traits, we would recommend a home with older children. Overall, Lemmy is a wonderful, lovable, and adoptable dog who would love a family to shower him with affection and belly rubs. We know despite his quirks, Lemmy deserves a sweet family who will love him regardless.

We still need to raise $3,500 for his emergency liver shunt surgery. \n\nDecember is the season of giving - so lets give Veeru a fighting chance. Will you be his Secret Santa and help save his life? \n\nVeeru has been through a lot in his short life. From getting hit by a car in India and losing his leg, to this! He is a fighter and he really needs your help.\n\nDue to the liver shunt, Veeru's liver values are at 600, whereas the normal level is less than 10. If he can receive this surgery, the values will lower permanently, and he can go back to living a normal life. To make him more stable for the surgery, he is now on special hepatic food which makes it easy for his liver to process. He is also on Lactulose 3 times a day which will help eliminate some of the toxins from his body.\n\n#adoptdontshop #reascuedogsofinstagram #emergency #emergencysurgery #rescuedog #tripoddog #tripoddogsofinstagram #tripoddogsrule #veeru", "WE DID IT.

Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, Chand's freedom flight was significantly delayed. He waited almost a full year before traveling to the U.S. in February 2021. Unfortunately, Chand is still waiting for the perfect place to land. \n\nChand's siblings Jaiya, Leena, and Zara have been settled in their furever homes for some time. Though Chand has overcome a lot, he's struggled to adapt to life with his adopters. Their current living situation requires a lot of travel and time out of the home, and it's not the best fit for our boy. Chand was an affectionate and outgoing pup when in India, and still has a great, goofy personality. However, he's fearful of new people, places, and needs calm and consistency to thrive. \n\nCurrent location:  New Hampshire \n\nChand needs support in: \n\t\u2022\tHouse manners: not chewing inappropriate objects or jumping on counters.\n\t\u2022\tSeparation anxiety: Chand will need help learning how to calmly be at home alone. He's struggled with crate training, and will need to re-learn that it's a safe space to relax.\n\t\u2022\tStranger danger: Chand struggles with meeting and warming up to new people, and can be skittish around unfamiliar humans. \n\t\u2022\tProper intros to other dogs: Chand does well with other dogs once he's had a proper introduction, and may even do well living with another confident dog. Intros need to be slow and supported with positive reinforcement. \nWe're looking for a special adopter or adoptive family to: \n\t\u2022\tCommit to working closely with our positive reinforcement trainer for a minimum of 1 year. Cost of this training will be covered by the Foundation.\n\t\u2022\tIntegrate species-appropriate activities and enrichment that will fulfill Chand's needs, like sniffing! \n\t\u2022\tHave a consistent schedule and a supportive environment for Chand.

They diagnosed her with spirocerca lupi, a parasite found in India where she is from but nearly non existent in the US. These worms are brutal. They are living in her esophagus creating masses. The masses are hopefully benign and curative with treatment but they can become cancerous. So after lots of research and discussion, we decided to do further diagnostics on Monday (including endoscopy and likely a CT scan) to help make the best decision for Kami. Since she can't have the tests until Monday, I picked her up from Penn last night to give her every moment of comfort and happiness I can this weekend. She's tired and not herself but eating great, wagging her tail, and enjoying the sun \ud83c\udf1e the initial estimate from Penn was $4000-6000.

Her family abandoned her when they moved away from Bangalore. She was alone and hungry and ate something toxic which lead her to become extremely sick. When Madhu found Happy she couldn't walk, couldn't eat and couldn\u2019t even get up on her own. Madhu brought her to the vet where she was diagnosed with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. After a week at the hospital and a month at a foster home, she recovered fully. But, unfortunately Happy continued to experience more bad luck. We were unable to find her a foster family so she has been living at a boarding facility for her enitre live. Months and months went by and no one in India wanted to adopt her. So we made the decision to bring her to the USA. Not once, not twice, but three times for one reason or another something inhibited her from flying. Then Corona virus took over and stalled the possibility of getting Happy to the USA.

He will present his belly to you the second you go for a pet, and if you stop petting him he will shove his nose under your hand as a reminder to return. He has amazingly soft fur. He also loves slow feeders, bones of all kinds, balls, and snuffle mats. \n\nSince arriving to New York, he\u2019s spent two weeks in a suburban house (Check w Kristina) and a month in an apartment in Cambridge, MA. In both instances, he pretty quickly became comfortable in the bedroom with his crate, but is taking time to get comfortable with other areas of the house - novelty in general is a stressor for Chand and he needs a patient family that will give him lots of time and controlled exposure to support him as he continues to cross new boundaries. He hasn\u2019t yet gotten comfortable with a person that\u2019s not his primary person, so introductions will need to be slow. \n\nTo that end, somewhere quiet with access to a yard would be great for Chand.

When she was 3 months old, Happy was abandoned by her owner on the road when he left the city. She was alone and hungry and ate something toxic which made her extremely sick. When @maddieness_now found her she couldn't walk, couldn't eat, couldn\u2019t even get up on her own. They picked her up and took her to the vet. She was diagnosed with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. After a week at the hospital and a month at a foster home, she recovered fully. Unfortunately Happy continued to experience bad luck. Months and months went by and no one in India wanted to adopt her. So we made the decision to bring her to the USA. Not once, not twice but three times for one reason or another something inhibited here from flying. Then Corona virus took over the world and stalled the possibility of getting Happy to the USA. Happy is almost two years old and all she wants is a family to love her. Our first goal of 2021 is getting this girl to the USA. But, we desperately need your help as she has now been in paid boarding for over 16 months. We need your help in covering her boarding cost as currently we owe $650.

She is settling in with her foster mama and we have learned that she loves toys and just can\u2019t pick one. If you don\u2019t remember Kami is one of the three sisters who has Cerebellar hypoplasia. While in India Kami also tested positive for heart worm. As you may or may not know heart worm is not common in India but unfortunately cases are increasing. Which is a huge problem as the treatment for heart worm can not be found in India. We then tested Kami again for heart worm and it came back as negative. We all made the assumption that her first test was a false positive. Unfortunately, we re tested her to be safe when she arrived to the USA and her test came back as positive. I am heart broken as this mean it will take several months for he treatment to be over. Dr. Ravi of Compassion Vet Clinic our partner vet will use Kamis case as a case study. We are hoping to use her case as a way to raise awareness in India regarding heart worm.

Dogs have a way to touch our hearts in ways that I didn\u2019t even know were possible. Indian Street Dogs deserve the same love that pedigree dogs receive in India. If you live in India give a Street Dog a chance. Start by feeding them or by reaching out to local NGOs to get them spayed and neutered.

But, I could not say no. I immediately contacted @desi_dogfather of @indielove_desi to see if he could care for them until they could come to the USA. Thankfully Sunil said yes.

Kali then went to her amazing foster home @jen0585 where she made so many new friends. Kim the founder of Be like Josh Foundation made sure Kali was fully vetted. Then an amazing family living in Washington wanted to adopt Kali. The Be Like Josh Foundation organized the transport chain from Arizona to Washington.

We immediately shifted her to @indielove_desi . Prior to being shifted to Indie Love she was seen by our amazing vet, Dr. C, to run blood work. She has been diagnosed with Heart Worm. In India they do not have the treatment but thankfully our partner vet in the USA is ordering the supplies so that they can be shipped to India.", "I just realized that Delhi the Street Dog Foundation has successfully brought over 100 dogs from India, 101 if you count Delhi!

Thank you to everyone who has fostered, transported, donated, followed us and liked our posts. \n\nI have made a lot of mistakes over the last two years and continue to learn to not only be a better dog rescuer but a better person. I still have a lot that I need to work on but here is to the future of the Foundation even though I am not exactly sure what the future holds. THANK YOU for believing in me.", "And then there was 6. With Kali and Karishma arriving yesterday to the USA  that now leaves 6 Foundation dogs still stuck in India.

We\u2019re still in awe that they survived so long on their own, and glad they can now get the care they deserve. After Delhi the Street Dog took on their case, Kaali and Karishma were transported to Dr. Choudhary\u2019s Pet Clinic.

Where we keep our equipment I met Theo's mom. She had a litter, was killed by other strays on the campus and Theo was the lone survivor. I always wrestled with bringing Lucy, his mom home. But I never did. After what happened I decided to take this 10 month old pup home. \nI had him chipped, vaccinated and flew him here to Seattle. \n\nHe has serious PTSD regarding other dogs from his experience.\nI've been working on that. He obviously can get along with other dogs as in my situation. But I have Basenjis. He's part Pariah dog by the looks of him. I'm basically trying to take an established pair of domesticated coyotes and integrate a third coyote from another pack who has trust issues. \n\nPeople have always treated Theo with kindness. He LOVES people. Other dogs are a big issue. He will attack any other dog unprovoked. He'll go after them in attack mode. Doesn't matter the size of the dog. \nMy neighbor took him for a walk awhile back this past summer. Took him inside his house and he has cats. He said Theo didn't care about the cat. But that's all I can attest to regarding cats. \n\nHe has marking issues inside my  home. It's a constant struggle between my male Basenji and Theo. No matter how much I walk him he has something in the tank.\n\nHe doesn't destroy anything unless you leave your shoes out. \n\nHe is very playful but gets a little nippy with people of small stature. It's correctable. He won't do it to me any more but seems to with women and kids. But it's only a playful thing. \nHe's very intelligent, trainable and  obedient. \n\nHe needs to be in an only dog home with a fenced yard or measures in place to prevent him getting out. When he gets out you had better get him quickly or hope someone on the street without a dog will grab him. He won't come to me when he escapes. Its s game of look at me I'm free again as he sprints about.\n\nI've been working with him on aggression towards the neighbor dogs and running back and forth along the fence line.

She has been in Vancouver for almost a year. She was hit by a car not once but twice while in India. Her back right foot is missing a toe, and it has taken months of dressing changes and vet visits to rehabilitate her. She still has to have a little bit of TLC for her foot and wear a boot when she goes to the park. Even though she limps, she is now the fastest dog at the dog park and a good little hiker! The vet is currently very happy with where she is at and she no longer requires frequent visits! Alice endured a lot of trauma prior to being rescued. She has finally overcome here fear of cars and men. She currently lives with another dog, and she can be territorial and not want to share her toys. However, she gets along fantastic with other dogs at the dog park. We are currently working on leash reactivity and she has been doing great with distraction and treats. She would need a home with a patient, loving owner who can understand and appreciate her struggles and help her to continue to overcome them. She is good at being home for a few hours alone. She is very protective of her home and will bark at strangers walking by on occasion. Her owners have to rehome her due to unforeseen circumstances and at no fault of Alice. Alice truly is an old, beautiful soul. She is a survivor and a dog that anyone would be lucky to have in their lives. \n\nPlease email jesshoemay@gmail.com if you are interested in adopting Alice.

He has an amazing foster family waiting to care for him until his perfect family is found. Please help us so we can give him the live he deserves. Read his story below. \n.\n.\n\u201cBagheera was one of four pups born in Ojas\u2019 family\u2019s society in Gurgaon. His sister Vidhi had begun taking care of his mom (named Kalu) when she was a pup. When she gave birth to Bagheera and his litter mates, Vidhi had build a shelter for them which unfortunately raised a lot of complaints from people living in the society. Throughout their early life, people who were against dogs living in the community, had constantly dismantled their shelter and thrown them out into a nearby dumpster. And every evening when Vidhi would get back to work, Kalu would frantically howl and lead Vidhi to the location of her puppies. After several times of this back and forth the puppies were gone and in no location Kalu was able to point out for Vidhi. It was around the time of their absence that myself and Ojas came in from New York to celebrate our wedding. While preparing for the festivities, a security guard of the society had spotted a dog barely moving with a simple cast wrapped around his front paw. I immediately scooped him up and looked up a nearby vet to take him to. The whole way he cried and cuddled in my arms which made me think of the name Bear or Bagheera since he was much like a teddy bear. In such pure coincidences, the vet we ended up seeing had been the vet that wrapped his leg. He told us that another woman brought him in but they could not afford the necessary procedures that he would need to get better. So out of the goodness of her heart, Vidhi paid for all of the expenses of his boarding and treatments during our wedding! Bagheera is now @indielove_desi waiting for his happy ever after.\u201d", "Yesterday, my sweet boy turned 3.

I should have posted an update on Noddy weeks ago. This is going to be a very transparent post as my goal when starting this Foundation was always to be truthful.\nNot every Indian Street dog is suitable for coming to the USA. Sometimes their street dog instincts are so strong that they struggle when arriving to the USA. I do my best to ensure that when sending dogs to the USA that they are going to be able to thrive in their new environment.\nNoddy is an amazing dog but really struggled to adapt to her new life in the USA. This is my fault for not having the infrastructure set up to handle a dog who would require a long term foster and training. As you know we struggled finding Noddy a foster and unfortunately she was not suitable for my apartment. This meant she bounced around between fosters causing her more anxiety and unrest. Noddy did bite a handful of people which lead to a very stressful situation which made everyone abandon the Foundation. It\u2019s just me running the foundation now. I brought up the fact that due to her bit history she could be a danger to the community. My lawyer told us that one law suit against us would end the Foundation. I was crying myself to sleep every night because I honestly did not know what to do for Noddy. I felt so hopeless! I knew that Noddy was under so much stress and was not an aggressive dog. Every time she bit someone was because she was not handled properly. I knew that it was my fault but didn\u2019t know how to solve the problem. I emailed 100s of rescues for help feeling like a complete idiot because I irresponsibly brought a dog over and needed help desperately. I needed someone who could offer her a stable environment.\nI am beyond grateful that @animalhopeandwellness offered Noddy a spot at their amazing rescue. She is now thriving and has never been happier. I am forever thankful for them giving our girl the chance she deserved.\nI am still completely broken and do not know if the Foundation will ever recover. I am just one person trying to do the work of 5 people.

Originally from Delhi, India Noddy is a one-year-old, white/tan, spayed female Indian street dog. She's traveled thousands of miles through a series of difficult situations to find a better life in the USA. Noddy is looking forever family that understands she'll need space and time to relax and learn to trust them. Once she knows you're \"her person\" she's loyal, snuggly and oh-so-sweet.\n:\nHistory: Noddy was brought into a home from the streets as a tiny puppy, but as soon as she grew in size, her humans sadly grew tired of her. They tied her up indoors with a very short lead and she was severely neglected. If she barked, Noddy was beaten with brooms and mops. She was rescued and moved to an amazing local boarding facility outside Delhi where she got care, complete freedom, and spent days playing \\with other dogs. Noddy traveled to Seattle in March.\n:\nNoddy thrives when she's outdoors and is a great hiking/walking/running companion who will make an incredible adventure buddy for exploring the PNW. She's good on a leash and has excelled in recall training. Due to her past, however, Noddy has displayed anxious behavior when inside and can become possessive of the couch, bed, or other items in the house and as a result has bitten in the past. She's crate trained and is also working on muzzle training.\n:\nNoddy would do best as a solo animal (no other dogs or cats), or with someone who can keep both dogs separate until she learns the resident dog isn't a threat. Outside the home, she loves playtime with pup friends and has done well at the dog park and doggy playdates. Noddy excels with boundaries, calm, and consistency, and needs an adults-only home with parents that have dog experience. She's not suited to apartment living.\n:\nNoddy is looking for a very special family ready to commit to Noddy. She does have a bite history making this a very sensitive case that will require a lot of time and dedication. We have a trainer willing to work with the adoptive family that will be paid for by the foundation.\n:\nPlease help us find Noddy her fairytale ending.\nPlease email us at info@delhithestreetdogfoundation.org", "Do you remember Rani???\n.\n.\nThis is what Rani looked like when she first arrived to Seattle from India.

When @mowgli_the_indie_dog went out for their daily feedings of street dogs they discovered Angel screaming out in pain and unable to move. They determined that she must have been crying for hours while people just passed by ignoring a helpless puppy. They immediately rushed her to vet and she started her road to recovery.\n.\n.\nIt took 45 days for Angel to recover which required them to travel 50kms every week to take her to a vet in Delhi as the vets in the area lacked experience. A few days after she was finally able to walk again she was diagnosed with Parvo. But, Angel fought Parvo and survived because she was a fighter.\n.\n.\nOn May 14th she was hit by a car again but this time she took her last breath. Someone just ran her over and didn\u2019t even look back.\n.\n.\nWhy did we choose to tell this story? We chose to tell this story because it represents the daily occurrence of what is happening to puppies all over India. They live short brutal life\u2019s and don\u2019t ever get the chance to know compassion and love. Many of you may ask well why wasn\u2019t she adopted out in India and placed back on the streets? This is because no one wanted to adopt her in India.\n.\n.\nThank you @mowgli_the_indie_dog for letting us share this story.

She had previously hidden her puppies, but later carried them one-by-one to me until all eight were in my lap.

For the next 10 days, I visited Sheila and her babies.\n.\n.\nThough I pleaded with my parents to let me bring Sheila home, it wasn\u2019t possible. She had eight little puppies to look after! I was heartbroken. But we returned to Jamaica a year later for another vacation, this time armed with research and a referral from a local vet about how to bring my friend home to the USA.

Who needs some good news? Toffee (now Clover) had a tough start, but is now soaking up the love of a forever family.\n.\n.\nClover is the sole survivor of her litter. One of her siblings was killed after being hit on the head with a rod. The remaining puppies, including Clover, contracted the deadly Parvo virus. They received treatment, recovered, and were released back to their territory. Clover was very weak and got attacked by other dogs, so was taken back into care. Her two remaining siblings developed Distemper and one died. Stitch recovered and was preparing to travel, but suddenly passed on two weeks ago.\n.\n.\nWe\u2019re thrilled that Clover is happy, healthy, and home.

First, I hope you\u2019re staying healthy and safe right now, and taking measures to help you, your loved ones, and your community do the same. Just as I\u2019m sticking close to home with Delhi and Oscar, I hope you\u2019re cuddled up with your fur babies and making the most of a difficult time.\n.\n.\nWe have no idea to what extent the measures being put in place right now - closing of borders, halting visas, social distancing, etc. - will impact our lives as individuals, or what effect they\u2019ll have on what we do for dogs. I left India on one of the last available flights. We\u2019ve posted adoption appeal after adoption appeal to no avail. We have possible adopters and fosters in Canada, but can\u2019t get there. People are confused, scared, and being cautious. (Though we really hope they\u2019ll take a chance at an awesome dog.) What I do know is that now is the time to come together instead of creating silos. To follow procedures to the letter. To limit our risks.\n.\n.\nInternational dog rescue is ever-changing, and current events mean changes are happening faster.  It\u2019s critical that all rescues are bring dogs into Canada and the U.S. legally for the dogs\u2019 safety and so rescues can continue to operate. This means hiring a customs broker to get import paperwork done completely and correctly. All rescue dogs entering the U.S. also need to be pre-approved by the USDA.\n.\n.\nWhen I started Delhi the Street Dog Foundation I was full of drive to make a difference, but not always the know-how to make it happen. I figured stuff out (or so I thought), followed what other people were doing, and have made some mistakes along the way. I\u2019ve learned from them and hope others can too.\n.\n.\nMore than ever, the rescue community needs to work together and follow proper policies. We can save lives without putting the future of rescue at risk. We\u2019re hoping that other rescues will join us. We\u2019ll be reaching out to others in rescue to see how we can support each other and commit to doing things \u201cthe right way\u201d. Are you in? If you have questions, we hope you\u2019ll contact us. We\u2019re all in this together. (2/2)", "The past week and a half has felt like a whirlwind. I\u2019m still decompressing from my trip to #India and up the West Coast, just like our #dogs. In addition, I\u2019m processing how we accomplished bringing 12 dogs to the U.S. in the midst of a pandemic, and what that pandemic will mean for #dogrescue now and in the future. (More on that in a second post.) The world is in a strange place right now, and I\u2019m lucky I have Delhi and my foster Oscar to hunker down with, because when things get crazy, dogs really ground me.\n.\n.\nBeing back in India and seeing #streetdogs firsthand also really grounded me. In #Seattle I don\u2019t have to see strays suffer in person, and in that way the distance makes our work easier. To be honest, there are many times when I think about giving up rescue - shuttering Delhi the Street Dog Foundation and living a \u201cnormal\u201d life, whatever that is. I\u2019m exhausted from working a full-time job and running a full-time foundation. I\u2019m tired of fighting for rescues to work together for animals instead of arguing over flight volunteers. I\u2019m weary from people trying to tear down our hard work because they don\u2019t understand something and lash out instead of reaching out.\n.\n.\nIn many ways, coming back to India felt like coming #home. I didn\u2019t just travel across the world to reach a destination, but to reignite my passion. It reminded me of my purpose and just how much I love these Desi dogs!\n.\n.\nI\u2019m glad that we made a last minute decision for me to travel, and so grateful to everyone who helped us pull off getting 12 dogs from India to the U.S. on a week\u2019s notice. I still don\u2019t know how we did it, but it feels pretty amazing. So many people played an important role in making this happen. ALL of you played an important role in making this happen.

Every dollar you donate goes to helping spay/neuter and vaccinating dogs in India or in some cases by getting dogs that are not adoptable in India into new homes in the US.  Rani was a dog we agreed to bring over in October 2019.  She had been hit by a car as a puppy and suffered severe trauma.  She had been treated and was in a foster home but that placement was ending shortly and she was going to be put back on the street.  She would never have made it in her condition so we agreed to get her to the US. When Rani arrived she was in even worse shape than we thought. We quickly took her in to multiple vets to get checked out. Not only did she have severe abnormalities in her leg bones and joints she also had significant muscle atrophy and issues walking. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough she also had multiple skin issues.  We were so concerned as to how we were going to get this sweet but broken girl adopted.  Thankfully one of our amazing followers, Jessica Miller, saw her and felt an immediate connection with this sweet girl.  Jessica took Rani in and the results have been phenomenal. In just a few short months of consistent love, nutrition and working on gaining muscle mass - little Rani is a whole new dog!! These are the types of cases which keep us doing what we do despite all the obstacles and hardships we face.  This is why we need to keep asking for your donations - to help dogs like Rani - who would have quickly died a sad, painful death on the streets but instead is living the best, most meaningful life here in the US so THANK YOU from Rani and all of us at Delhi the Street Dog Foundation and please continue to help us help more dogs like her \u2764\ufe0f (The photos are in sequence of her progress)\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#washingtonstate #washington #pnw #pacificnorthwest #pnwdogs #pacificcoasthighway #pnwdogs #pnwonderland #pnwlife #pnwdogsofinstagram #pnwphotography #pnwroamers #pnwrescue #pnwrescuedogs #seattle #seattledogs #seattledoggos #seattlerescuedogs #seattlephotographer #seattlelife #seattledogsquad #seattledogsofinstagram #seattlerescues #pnwdogslife #pnwonderdogsens", "We need your help!\n\nAs you can imagine sending a dog from India to the USA or Canada can be expensive.

Unfortunately Cheeni's placement didn't last long. He was restricted to a small outside area, neglected, and ultimately had to be removed. He later fell ill with tick fever, but has since been treated and is fully recovered. He\u2019s neutered and up to date on vaccinations.\n.\n.\nCheeni is an excellent team player. He's great with other dogs, loves kids, and wants to please \"his people.\" He'd make a great dog for first time owners, or for a family seeking a loyal companion. And although he loves to chomp on Milk Bones, there's not a mean bone in his body. Plus, get a look at that snoot people!\n.\n.\nWant to make Cheeni your star player?

He was a nervous boy, but his quirky personality won Mom and Dad's affection and he quickly came out of his shell. One by one, all of our littermates were adopted in India, the U.S., and Canada, but Drake (then Flakes) couldn't catch a break.  Drake's foster was set to end and there was nowhere for him to go.\n.\n.\nDelhi the Street Dog got Drake to the U.S. where Delhi began to foster him in Seattle. Won over by Delhi's mom sending pictures, videos, and good-est boy updates on Drake, our pawrents decided it was time for Domino and Drake to be a dynamic duo once again. Our reunion was set to a soundtrack of Dom barking for 24 hours, but at the end of day one our sibling rivalry was over and we've been inseparable ever since.  We traveled over 7,000 miles to reunite, and every one of them was worth it.\n.\n.\nCheck out this video to see how we grew this year, and celebrate our first revolution around the sun by helping us give back to Delhi the Street Dog.

When I first met him at Animal Haven shelter in NYC, it was love at first sight. Quite frankly, I knew in my heart I was meant to give the handsome tri-pod with the soulful eyes the loving, safe home he rightfully deserved. In all honesty, I was not sure what to expect when I brought Noah home: He was abused in the worst way possible: would he be aggressive? How will he adapt to living in a home and off the streets? Even though I had all of these questions running through my mind, I decided to love him unconditionally from the moment I signed his papers and weather any storm that would come our way with patience, gentleness, and kindness. While Noah\u2019s transition was mostly easy (we\u2019re still working on walking!), he has taught me to live my life with patience, gentleness, and kindness. Before he became my fur-baby, he endured horrors on the streets of India that I cannot even begin to think about, yet he has the kindest heart and most gentle temperament I\u2019ve ever encountered in any living being on this planet. That being said, I literally refer to him as my spirit animal as he has made stop and realize that things in life could always be worse and that I should always be grateful for the cards I\u2019ve been dealt -- even when life gets a bit tough.

His one white and one brown ear is so cute! He was born to a mother who had been marked as spayed but wasn\u2019t. He was born in a neighborhood where people poured boiling water on newborn pups to try and kill them. 2 of the puppies died but Jack survived and was placed in foster care. He is good with people and loves to snuggle.\n.\nRani is a 7 month old female. She was found on the road as a puppy after most likely being hit by a car. She had multiple fractures but was thankfully taken in by a rescuer that got her treatment and she\u2019s ready for her new home.  She is friendly with all and would enjoy a home with an adventurous family.\n.\nIf you are interested in any of these dogs you can email Eileen@delhithestreetdogfoundation.org or fill out an adoption form at our website.

I followed my heart and passion and for some reason all of you amazing people have decided to join me on the journey. I am not perfect, I have made many mistakes while running this rescue and I will continue to make mistakes and will continue to learn. I struggled with mental health prior to starting this rescue and is something that I am extremely open about. This has not been easy on my mental health and has had a huge impact on my happiness. Any rescuer knows exactly what I am saying. But, in the end it\u2019s worth it because a life was saved. My day is consumed with thoughts on how we can make a bigger difference but to be honest there is one thing sitting in the way of making an impact and that is Money. I hate that the world relies on money and that money is what allows us to bring change. I joke all the time about selling my organs but seriously if I could I would. We have tried creative ways to raise money but nothing seems to stick.  We have tried doing a $1 campaign which did not result in the success we were hoping. What do we do?

He went to the beach and went on a hike. Flakes is a shy but extremely sweet and cuddly boy. Once he knows you are his person he is extremely loyal. He is playful and loves digging in the sand. Also, Flakes is completely potty trained and is good with cats, dogs and kids. He is pretty much perfect. He is still scared of the world around him but in just a short period of time he is already come out if his shell. Flakes is truly a once in a life time dog.

These pups are later discarded by families who realise they are not purebred dogs but came from the street. Very few people empathise with street dogs here and our volunteer, Chhavi, spends a large part of her time trying to appeal to the conscience of people by speaking to them about empathising with street dogs and ensuring sterilisations with our partner organisation Dogs of Delhi: Spay & Neuter for the dogs in this area. She has already sterilised a total of 134 dogs in the last few months. Karol Bagh has hundreds of unsterilised dogs, and with this drive, we are trying to make a dent in that population.

However there were no small dogs on the euthanize list that day, instead they offered a husky who was mouthy and very untrained. \nTori being the optimistic person she is went into the back to meet this husky, at first glance she knew she had to take him. She could see his growl behind the kennel wasn't mean, he was scared, his bark at her when she reached her hand out wasn't threatening it was playful, and the mouthiness was just a untrained puppy being a puppy.\n\nSo she got him a vet appointment for the next day and booked his kennel on her flight. Tori and our newest American street dog will be arriving back to Seattle on Saturday!\n\nThe pup had been a stray, found on the streets running around living a scared and fearful life. At the shelter he was not vetted because they didn't plan to keep him around due to his puppy like traits. No one came to claim him as a lost pet and only one staff member in the whole shelter would go near or walk him as the rest were afraid.

Luna has been in the care of our incredible partner Paw in Need. Sonali from Paw in Need single handedly takes care of all the dogs on her college campus. Luna has been with her community for a while and has become family to her care takers and fellow street dogs. She is a gentle soul who has cared for her litters and orphaned litters who lost their mama too soon.\n\nA few nights ago, Luna was purposefully hit by a vehicle and left to die on the side of the road. This horrible human being even reversed the car and ran back over her in attempts to kill her. This is unfortunately the reality of the horrors that our dogs endure throughout their lives on the streets of India. Our amazing partner heard her cry and immediately tried to find her care. She has been diagnosed with a broken femur and pelvis. We are not yet sure if she is paralyzed, and are anxiously awaiting to hear more news.\n\nPaw in Need is primarily ran by a sole college student. We have offered to step up and help pay for Luna\u2019s veterinary care, boarding and flight to the United States to find her forever home.

She tries her best to look after as many dogs as possible but is constantly short on funds.\n\nThe dogs dwelling in these slums are not looked after well by the locals and their puppies die litter after litter. They are vast areas of poverty, with makeshift homes, small shops, lots of dirt, rubble and dust. Pups born in these areas die in accidents, in cruelty cases or of starvation. We plan to cover the region area by area and venture into more slums. \nLeaving even a single dog unsterilized in one area hinders stabilisation of the population as it will continue to grow exponentially, so doing this systematically is extremely important. \nWe have already arranged four pick up dates: July 31st, August 2nd, August 17th, August 31st.

He was found with a limp and his body was covered in wounds. He would get startled if you touched him because he didn't trust humans. He gobbled his first meal as if he hadn't eaten for days. We tried our best to find his mother, but we could not, so we could not release him back on the streets as he could be attacked by other dogs as he was not in his territory. The vet confirmed that Moses had been hit, and that he was very weak. But within a few days, it became obvious that beneath the fear and trauma lay hidden a cuddly, happy puppy! It will be very difficult to find Moses a home in India. People say \"so cute\" but rarely offer to adopt an Indian puppy.

She would be a great hiking buddy or running partner. She would do best in an active family.

She does know how to sit, lay down, paw and touch. She is almost a 100 percent potty trained.  Tyra is very easy to train as she is extremely food motivated and just wants to please you.

During this time, her temporary fosters decided that she was too much to handle and agreed that turning her over to someone who had very recently stepped up, claiming she wanted to take Scout in, would be the best choice for her. A plane ticket was booked and Scout was set to go to Michigan on January 16th. This is when we cancelled her free ride with Animal Haven.\n.\n.\nThen, just days before the new year, and only two weeks before Scout was set to be picked up by her new foster and potential adopter, just like her feet, she began to chew on her own tail until it was haphazardly disconnected, leaving bone and tendon exposed. While we encourage that she seek rehab or the opinion of a neurologist, something so seemingly extreme could still be brought about by something as simple as situational anxiety. \nThe conversation quickly shifted from travel arrangements to talks of euthanasia.\n.\n.\nUnderstandably, the group was shook, but quickly ruled euthanasia out and it was decided that Scout would be shifted to a friend of the group\u2019s home in Texas who is both a nurse and dogs needs advocate after the adopter in Michigan felt it would be best for their family not to take Scout on given her recent tail encounter.\n.\n.\nToday is January 13th on the West Coast, and less than 20 hours ago, Scout was picked up from Wisconsin by a pet transport company and will be arriving in Texas no later than the morning of the 14th where most of us feel confident that she will be thriving upon arrival. She is up for adoption and still waiting for the forever home that will love and accept Scout despite her special needs.\n.\n.\nScout\u2019s funding page is also still active because her medical needs have demanded much more than we have both raised and donated as a group, and it can be found at www.gofundme.com/scoutonwheels \u2063\n\u2063\nThank you, generous friends, for getting us this far. #specialneedsdog #adoptme #doginawheelchair #handicapablepets #handicapabledog\n\nMusic Credit: Landslide, covered by The Smashing Pumpkins", "Part 2 of 3\n\nThis is when her rescuers from the United States stepped in and raised funds to have Scout shifted to a medical boarding in India, in addition to paying for her hind leg amputation surgeries to avoid any further infection, which had reached her bone, all the while searching for a way to get her to the United States.\n.\n.\nGiven the circumstances, it didn\u2019t take long to find a flight volunteer to open their heart to the journey, and it was at this time that this mission partnered up with Delhi the Street Dog Foundation who very quickly found Scout a safe haven in NYC who were prepared to deal with all of Scout\u2019s medical and even extreme financial needs.\n.\n.\nOn her way from India, to the United States, more than one person expressed an interest in either fostering or adopting or accepting partial or full financial responsibility for Scout. I don\u2019t think I am speaking for myself when I say that Scout is the most special needs dog I have worked with to date, so admittedly, a degree of naivety was demonstrated on both my and \u201cTeam Scout\u2019s\u201d end (the team being a group of some of the most dedicated people I have ever met, messaging tirelessly about logistics for weeks proceeding the flight) when discussing and contemplating her next steps.\n.\n.\nDespite having no solid commitment, the group decided and still felt assured enough by our potential interests, to begin the discussion about cancelling her early January move-in date to Animal Haven in New York City. Scout arrived in Wisconsin from New Delhi in mid December of 2018 where she was set to be temporarily fostered through the holidays with her flight buddy and his fianc\u00e9, even though the group secretly hoped at first that it would lead to an adoption and were even given vague inklings of this possibly being the case by the couple.", "Part 1 of 3 \nI dare you not to cry while watching this video.\n\nwww.gofundme.com/scoutonwheels\n.\n.\nAround this time last year, a hopeful pup was born to the streets of India close to a University. This doesn\u2019t always have to be a dismal situation considering the growing compassion and progressive thinking of the youth of the 21st century. The pup was befriended and fed by locals, and eventually named \u201cScout\u201d by those who would come to call themselves her rescuer.\n.\n.\nOne day while out on a \u201cscouting mission\u201d, one of her favorite pastimes which also obviously gained her a name, it was learned that Scout was encountered by a few adolescent men who proceeded to beat her with a stick until her back legs were rendered useless. Her sisters \u201cSocks\u201d and \u201cLips\u201d also in this video, remained unharmed. \nScout, less than two months old, spent nine days dragging around in the streets before her rescuers came to her aid where she was quickly brought into foster care, fit with a wheelchair and earned a new name: Scout on Wheels.\n.\n.\nAs her injuries continued to heal, the fractures and broken bones set in such a way which would eventually cause Scout to break her femur as she was, ironically, being transported to a vet visit. It is still yet to be determined if this were the cause, but it wasn\u2019t long after this time that Scout began to chew off her own paws.", "Our goal at Delhi the Street Dog Foundation is to be as transparent as possible with the work that we are doing in India. We want you to know exactly how your donations are being used. To remind everyone we are 100 percent volunteer run. In all honesty things have been a little hectic for us as everyday we are learning something new and have had to overcome many challenges.

It is an interesting feeling, but sometimes you JUST KNOW that you are meant to save a particular animal. Some primordial force takes over and you are seemingly illogically connected. It can almost be equated to the love one feels for their child, or like having a \u201cdog\u2019s sense of smell\u201d.\n.\n.\nWe realize it can get confusing, seeing posts day after day of different (and just so many) dogs seeking their ideal family or transport to their forever homes. We here at Delhi the Street Dog Foundation are a small team, and further, we have been talking about how to pace ourselves so that each rescue case is like a fine microbrew... personal, manageable and giving us the opportunity to give our full attention to those involved with the rescue, foster or even better, the adoption.\n.\n.\nOur goal right now is to help 50 dogs a year, or ideally 4-5 dogs per month. Of course not every case can be fit so perfectly into the parameters of a time frame - take Scout for instance - she has been an ongoing rescue with very special needs that we have been working on for what seems like day and night since the Sunmer.

Please take a moment to read her story.\n\nHere is Veera\u2019s story as written by @maddieness_now, her rescuer:\nVeera was born in May 2018 to one of my street dogs. Both her parents - Simba and Heera - live on my street in Bangalore. She was one of a litter of three.\nBy the time Veera was a month old, she suddenly disappeared. She was picked up by someone. We didn't know who. In July 2018, both her mother and her sister Gina became severely ill and passed away after a short and severe illness. Her brother, Timber too disappeared after that. Again probably picked up, but we couldn't locate him again.\nAlmost four months after Veera was picked up, she reappeared again on my street. Clearly abandoned by her 'adopter,' she appeared very thin, weak and scared of the street. The big dogs in the locality didn't recognize her, chased her and she hid under parked cars for days.
